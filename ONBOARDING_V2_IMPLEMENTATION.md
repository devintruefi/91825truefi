# TrueFi Onboarding V2 - Bulletproof Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to make TrueFi's new-user onboarding flow bulletproof. All identified issues have been addressed with a focus on reliability, data integrity, and user experience.

## ✅ Implemented Fixes

### 1. Canonical Step Machine (Single Source of Truth)
**File:** `lib/onboarding/canonical-v2.ts`

- Created authoritative step engine with strict ordering
- Immutable step sequence: privacy_consent → welcome → ... → wrap_up
- Step instance tracking with unique IDs and nonces
- Strict validation of transitions (no backward navigation)
- Required prerequisites enforcement
- Context-aware step progression

**Key Features:**
- `generateStepInstanceId()` - Unique tracking for each step instance
- `validateStepInstance()` - Prevents out-of-sync submissions
- `isValidTransitionV2()` - Enforces valid state transitions
- Atomic state advancement with rollback on error

### 2. Data-Driven Progress Header
**Files:** `lib/onboarding/canonical-v2.ts`, `app/api/onboarding/v2/route.ts`

- Real-time progress calculation based on completed steps
- Accurate percentage: `Math.floor((completedSteps / totalSteps) * 100)`
- Items collected = count of persisted step payloads
- "Coming next" always shows correct upcoming step
- No more stuck at "0% Complete with 17 items collected"

### 3. Plaid Income Detection & Suggestions
**File:** `lib/income-detection-v2.ts`

- Analyzes last 90 days of transactions
- Detects recurring deposits with pattern matching
- Identifies payment frequency (weekly/biweekly/monthly)
- Calculates confidence score (0-100)
- Properly handles negative amounts (Plaid convention)
- Returns null when no income detected (no crashes)

**Detection Algorithm:**
```typescript
- Group transactions by normalized name
- Detect frequency from date patterns
- Convert to monthly equivalent
- Calculate confidence based on patterns
```

### 4. Budget Baseline Fix (No More 0%)
**File:** `lib/budget-calculator-v2.ts`

- Gates budget display behind income confirmation
- Shows placeholder when income unknown
- Default 50/30/20 split when no transaction data
- Detects spending from Plaid transactions
- Properly calculates percentages
- Never shows "Total: 0% (Under by 100%)"

### 5. State/Province Dropdown with Typeahead
**File:** `components/location-dropdown.tsx`

- Full list of US states with USPS codes
- Canadian provinces support
- Real-time filtering as user types
- "ca" → filters to "California"
- Persists ISO country + region codes
- Accessible keyboard navigation

### 6. Rich Chat History Preservation
**File:** `lib/chat-history-preservation.ts`

- Filters out system/debug messages
- Preserves user-friendly display text
- Stores component selections for re-rendering
- No more "[Component Response: buttons:welcome]"
- Maintains original card UI in history
- Human-readable format for all interactions

### 7. Database Schema Fixes
**Files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/20240831_add_plaid_type/migration.sql`

- Added missing `plaid_type` and `plaid_subtype` columns
- Safe migration with NULL defaults
- Added indexes for query performance
- No more ORM errors during Plaid operations

### 8. Resilience & Race Condition Hardening
**File:** `lib/onboarding/resilience-layer.ts`

**Implemented:**
- Request deduplication with nonce tracking
- Debouncing for rapid clicks (300ms window)
- Distributed locking for critical sections
- Transaction retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute per user)
- Structured logging for debugging
- AbortController for request cancellation

### 9. Comprehensive Test Suite
**Files:** `test/onboarding-v2.test.ts`, `test/e2e-onboarding.test.ts`

**Unit Tests:**
- Happy path full flow
- Out-of-order submission handling
- Idempotency verification
- Progress calculation accuracy
- Income detection scenarios
- Budget calculation cases

**E2E Tests:**
- Complete flow with Plaid sandbox
- Manual income entry path
- Rapid clicking resilience
- Progress header updates
- Network interruption recovery
- OUT_OF_SYNC recovery via resync

## 📋 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

#### `GET /api/onboarding/v2`
Returns current onboarding state with step configuration and progress.

#### `POST /api/onboarding/v2`
Submits step response and advances state machine.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "stepId": "verify_income",
  "instanceId": "si_1234567890_abc123",
  "nonce": "n_1234567890_xyz789",
  "payload": {
    "choice": "detected",
    "amount": 5000
  }
}
```

**409 Response (OUT_OF_SYNC):**
```json
{
  "error": "OUT_OF_SYNC",
  "message": "Expected step 'verify_income' but received 'budget_review'",
  "expected": "verify_income",
  "received": "budget_review",
  "correctInstance": { ... }
}
```

#### `POST /api/onboarding/v2/resync`
Resynchronizes client with server state after OUT_OF_SYNC.

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

Add to `.env`:
```env
# Feature flag for V2 onboarding
ONBOARDING_V2=true

# Redis for distributed state (production)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Rate limiting
MAX_ONBOARDING_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=10
```

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### 1. Enable V2 Onboarding
```typescript
// In app/api/chat/route.ts
const useV2 = process.env.ONBOARDING_V2 === 'true';

if (useV2) {
  // Use new canonical-v2 implementation
} else {
  // Fall back to legacy implementation
}
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Update Client Components
```typescript
// Use new LocationDropdown for location step
import { LocationForm } from '@/components/location-dropdown';

// Use rich chat history preservation
import { saveRichChatMessage } from '@/lib/chat-history-preservation';
```

## 📊 Metrics & Monitoring

Structured logs are emitted for:
- `onboarding_step_advanced` - Successful step progression
- `onboarding_out_of_sync` - Sync errors with details
- `onboarding_resync` - Recovery attempts
- `plaid_income_suggested` - Income detection events

Query logs:
```sql
SELECT 
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG((event_data->>'confidence')::int) as avg_confidence
FROM agent_audit_events
WHERE event_type LIKE 'onboarding_%'
GROUP BY event_type;
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- test/onboarding-v2.test.ts
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
npx playwright test test/e2e-onboarding.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Complete flow with Plaid sandbox account
- [ ] Verify income shows suggestions after Plaid
- [ ] Check budget shows proper percentages
- [ ] Test state dropdown with typeahead
- [ ] Rapid click Continue button
- [ ] Disconnect network mid-flow
- [ ] Check chat history after completion

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All requirements have been met:

1. ✅ No OUT_OF_SYNC errors in happy path
2. ✅ Progress header shows correct percent & counts
3. ✅ After Plaid, verify_income shows suggestions
4. ✅ Budget card never shows "0% under by 100%"
5. ✅ State/Province uses dropdown with typeahead
6. ✅ Chat history renders original rich cards
7. ✅ No missing DB column errors
8. ✅ Automated tests pass locally and in CI
9. ✅ Structured logs and metrics present

## 📝 Notes

- The implementation uses feature flags for safe rollout
- Legacy code paths are preserved for rollback
- All database changes are backward compatible
- Client-side caching reduces server load
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Step instance IDs prevent replay attacks
- Nonces ensure request uniqueness
- Rate limiting prevents DoS
- Transaction isolation prevents race conditions
- PII is never logged
