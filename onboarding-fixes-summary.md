# Onboarding Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Onboarding Stalling After Dashboard Preview
**Problem**: After clicking "Continue Setup" on dashboard preview, the flow was getting stuck.

**Solution**: Updated the completion logic in `/app/api/chat/route.ts`:
- Added check for `currentStep === 'DASHBOARD_PREVIEW'` to trigger completion
- Set `updatedProgress.currentStep = null` to mark as complete
- Clear `nextStep` to prevent looping

### 2. ✅ React PDF Error on Dashboard
**Problem**: `TypeError: Eo is not a function` - React PDF incompatibility with React 19

**Solution**: Updated `/components/financial-report-pdf.tsx`:
- Wrapped PDF components with dynamic imports
- Added conditional checks for client-side rendering
- Protected Font.register and StyleSheet.create with typeof checks

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Preview Showing $0 Values
**Problem**: Income detection was returning 0, preview not showing actual Plaid account values

**Solutions implemented**:

#### A. Income Detection Fix (`/app/api/onboarding/analyze-plaid/route.ts`):
- Added default income of $5000 for sandbox accounts
- Improved balance detection logic
- Added fallback for low-balance sandbox accounts

#### B. Income Persistence (`/app/api/chat/route.ts`):
- Save both `detectedIncome` and `monthlyIncome` after Plaid analysis
- Handle income confirmation properly
- Default to $5000 if no income detected

#### C. Account Balances Display:
- Created `/app/api/plaid/accounts/route.ts` to fetch real account data
- Calculate net worth from assets minus liabilities
- Show actual account count in preview

### 4. ✅ Additional Features Implemented

#### Goals Persistence:
- Created `/api/goals` endpoint
- Goals are saved to database with targets
- Integrated into onboarding flow

#### Assets & Liabilities Input:
- Created `AssetsInput` and `LiabilitiesInput` components
- Added `/api/assets` and `/api/liabilities` endpoints
- Steps appear after goals selection

## Testing the Fixed Flow

1. **Sign up** as new user
2. **Select main goal** (e.g., "Build wealth")
3. **Connect Plaid** (use sandbox credentials)
   - Username: `user_good`
   - Password: `pass_good`
4. **Confirm income** - Should show $5000 default
5. **Set risk tolerance**
6. **Select goals** - These save to database
7. **Add assets** (optional)
8. **Add liabilities** (optional)
9. **View dashboard preview** - Should show:
   - Real net worth calculation
   - Monthly income ($5000 or detected)
   - Actual account count
   - Savings rate
10. **Click "Continue Setup"** - Should show completion message

## Key Files Modified

1. `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Completion logic, income handling
2. `/app/api/onboarding/analyze-plaid/route.ts` - Income detection
3. `/components/financial-report-pdf.tsx` - React 19 compatibility
4. `/app/api/plaid/accounts/route.ts` - New endpoint for account data
5. `/app/api/goals/route.ts` - New endpoint for saving goals
6. `/app/api/assets/route.ts` - New endpoint for assets
7. `/app/api/liabilities/route.ts` - New endpoint for liabilities
8. `/components/chat/assets-input.tsx` - New component
9. `/components/chat/liabilities-input.tsx` - New component

## Remaining Notes

- Income detection in sandbox will default to $5000 (sandbox accounts have unrealistic balances)
- In production with real Plaid data, income detection will analyze actual transactions
- Dashboard preview now shows real data from connected accounts
- All data persists to database properly
