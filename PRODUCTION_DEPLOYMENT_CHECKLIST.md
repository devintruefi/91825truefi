## üîß Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Feature flag (start with false, then enable)
ONBOARDING_V2=false

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=<production-secret>

# OpenAI (if using AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=<production-key>

# Plaid
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=<production-id>
PLAID_SECRET=<production-secret>
PLAID_ENV=production
```

### Feature Flag Strategy
1. Deploy with `ONBOARDING_V2=false`
2. Test with internal users
3. Gradually enable for % of users
4. Full rollout after monitoring

## üì¶ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-deployment (Current Status: READY)
```bash
# On feat/onboarding-hardening branch
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feat: bulletproof onboarding v2 implementation"
git push origin feat/onboarding-hardening
```

### 2. Create Pull Request
- Title: "feat: Bulletproof Onboarding V2 - Fixes all critical issues"
- Description: Link to ONBOARDING_V2_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Reviewers: Assign team leads
- Labels: `enhancement`, `onboarding`, `priority-high`

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Production database
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'accounts' 
AND column_name IN ('plaid_type', 'plaid_subtype');
```

### 4. Deploy Application
```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Deploy to production (Vercel/AWS/etc)
npm run deploy:production

# Or if using Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Can start onboarding flow
- [ ] Progress header shows correct percentages
- [ ] State dropdown works with typeahead
- [ ] Plaid connection successful
- [ ] Income detection working
- [ ] Budget shows proper allocations
- [ ] Chat history preserved correctly

## üîç Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Onboarding Completion Rate**
   - Target: > 70%
   - Alert if < 50%

2. **OUT_OF_SYNC Errors**
   - Target: < 1% of sessions
   - Alert if > 5%

3. **Step Advancement Success**
   - Target: > 99%
   - Alert on repeated failures

4. **Income Detection Rate**
   - Target: > 80% for Plaid users
   - Monitor confidence scores

### Queries for Monitoring
```sql
-- Onboarding completion rate (last 24h)
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN is_complete THEN 1 END)::float / COUNT(*) * 100 as completion_rate
FROM onboarding_progress
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- OUT_OF_SYNC errors
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as error_count,
  event_data->>'stepId' as step
FROM agent_audit_events
WHERE event_type = 'onboarding_out_of_sync'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY event_data->>'stepId'
ORDER BY error_count DESC;

-- Income detection success
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN financial_goals->>'incomeDetectedAt' IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END)::float / 
  COUNT(*) * 100 as detection_rate
FROM user_preferences
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Disable feature flag
ONBOARDING_V2=false

# Restart application
npm run restart:production
```

### Code Rollback (< 30 minutes)
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Redeploy
npm run deploy:production
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)
```sql
-- Remove added columns (only if absolutely necessary)
ALTER TABLE accounts 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS plaid_type,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS plaid_subtype;
```

## ‚úÖ Go/No-Go Criteria

### GO Criteria (All must be met)
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code review approved
- [x] Database migration successful
- [x] Feature flag configured
- [x] Monitoring dashboards ready
- [x] Rollback plan tested
- [ ] Product owner approval
- [ ] On-call engineer assigned

### NO-GO Criteria (Any triggers delay)
- [ ] Critical bugs found in staging
- [ ] Database migration failures
- [ ] Performance degradation > 20%
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities identified
